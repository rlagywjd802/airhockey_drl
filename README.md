This is the capstone project of Hyojeong Kim, Namki Yu and Kyungeun Kim in Hanyang University.

## v1.0
Using Deep Q Network
* hyper parameters

$$\gamma = 0.99$$
$\alpha$ = 0.001
$\epsilon$ = 1.0
batch_size = 64



## v2.0
Goal : Using OpenAI Gym Environment
1. Add goal area
2. Add 'stop' action
3. Change CNN to DNN
